Known Errors:
No known errors BUT I am getting a NullReferenceException
when the time ends and the game moves to the End Menu scene
for some reason, however everything functions exactly as
intended/works properly so I am unsure of what is causing
that.

References:
Class Slides States and Events
Various online mini-tutorials on certain aspects (how to spawn targets randomly,
how to have sprites appear with raycasting, etc.)

Instructions:
Open Unity Build "Aim Trainer" and play!
Can also duplicate the target as many times as you want to have as many randomly
spawning targets as you want, but I prefer to have one only.
